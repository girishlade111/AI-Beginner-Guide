## üéØ Introduction

Overview:
- This guide helps you move from zero-to-productive in AI. It blends theoretical foundations with practical workflows, recommended tools, and decision checklists so you can build real projects quickly and responsibly.

What you will learn:
- Core concepts across ML, DL, NLP, CV, and RL
- How to set up your environment and select the right tools
- Proven learning and prompting strategies for efficiency
- How to evaluate models and ship reliable, ethical AI

FAQ:
- Do I need advanced math? Basic linear algebra, calculus, and probability help; we link to prerequisites and provide intuition-first explanations.
- Do I need a GPU? Not for everything. Many tasks run on CPU or hosted notebooks; we include options.

Advanced notes:
- Throughout the guide, ‚Äútrade-offs‚Äù boxes call out compute, data, latency, and safety implications for architectural choices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Overview:
- A pragmatic path to get your workstation or cloud environment ready and your first projects running.

Prerequisites:
- Basic Python (functions, classes, virtual environments)
- Math: vectors, matrices, derivatives, probability
- Git basics: clone, branch, commit, PR

Environment setup (local):
1. Install Python 3.10+ and Git
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` (Windows: `./.venv/Scripts/activate`)
3. Upgrade tooling: `pip install --upgrade pip uv` (or `pipx`)
4. Install core libs: `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter matplotlib seaborn`
5. Optional DL stack: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` (match CUDA) or `pip install tensorflow`

Cloud options:
- Google Colab, Kaggle Notebooks, or GitHub Codespaces for zero-setup environments

Project scaffold:
- Create a folder layout: `data/{raw,processed}` `notebooks/` `src/` `models/` `reports/` `configs/`
- Initialize git: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "init"`

Actionable tips:
- Pin versions in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Use `.env` and `python-dotenv` for secrets; never commit keys
- Start with small, clean datasets to iterate fast

FAQ:
- Why are my installs slow? Use wheels, local mirrors, or Mamba/Conda for scientific stacks.
- Colab timeout? Persist data to Drive and checkpoint models to cloud storage.

Advanced notes:
- For reproducibility, capture `pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt`, seed RNGs, and note hardware in experiment logs.

## üß† AI Fundamentals

Overview:
- Intuition-first explanations with precise references to deeper resources in the docs directory.

Key concepts:
- Machine Learning (ML): Learn f(x) ‚âà y from data, minimize loss, generalize to unseen samples
- Deep Learning (DL): Representation learning with neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- NLP: Tokenization, embeddings, attention, generation, evaluation (BLEU, ROUGE)
- Computer Vision: Convolutions, augmentations, detection/segmentation, metrics (mAP, IoU)
- Reinforcement Learning: Agents, policies, value functions, exploration/exploitation

Essential workflow:
1. Problem framing: classification, regression, generation, retrieval, RL control
2. Data pipeline: collection, labeling, splits, preprocessing, augmentation
3. Baselines: simple models first (logistic/linear, small CNN) with clear metrics
4. Iteration: error analysis, feature engineering, architecture tuning
5. Evaluation: cross-validation, stratification, calibration, uncertainty
6. Deployment: packaging, monitoring, rollback, feedback loops

Guides and deep dives:
- See docs/fundamentals.md for: loss functions, optimizers, regularization, initialization, normalization, and training dynamics.

Actionable tips:
- Always establish a trivial baseline and a ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù upper bound to anchor progress
- Prefer stratified splits and leak-free preprocessing with pipelines
- Log everything: params, metrics, artifacts, seeds

FAQ:
- Why does my model overfit? Too complex, not enough data, weak regularization; use dropout, weight decay, augmentations, or simpler models
- Which metric should I use? Match business objective: F1 for imbalanced classification, AUROC/PR-AUC for ranking, calibration for decision thresholds

Advanced notes:
- Understand dataset shift: covariate, label, concept; mitigate with robust training, DA, or domain adaptation

- GitHub Copilot: inline code suggestions, tests, and refactors; see docs/tools/github-copilot.md
- Midjourney / Stable Diffusion: text-to-image workflows; see docs/tools/
- Claude: document analysis and long-context reasoning

Frameworks & libraries:
- PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras for DL; scikit-learn for classical ML
- Hugging Face Transformers/Datasets/Evaluate for NLP
- LangChain, LlamaIndex for LLM application orchestration
- OpenAI API and other providers for hosted LLMs

Actionable tips:
- Cache models/datasets to avoid repeated downloads
- Use smaller distilled models when latency/cost matter
- Profile bottlenecks (I/O versus compute) before premature optimization

FAQ:
- Which DL framework should I learn? PyTorch is beginner-friendly; TensorFlow excels with TF Serving/TPUs
- Best place to get models? Hugging Face Hub with license-aware usage

Advanced notes:
- For retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), measure retrieval recall, response factuality, and latency distributions

## üí° Tips & Tricks

Overview:
- Pragmatic habits to ship faster with fewer errors.

Prompt engineering guide:
- Structure: role + context + task + constraints + examples + output format
- Chain-of-thought via step decomposition; ask for plans before answers when appropriate
- Self-critique: ‚ÄúEvaluate the previous answer for correctness and completeness‚Äù

Actionable recipes:
- Few-shot prompting with canonical examples improves stability
- Provide schemas (JSON/YAML) and ask the model to conform
- Use delimiters and explicit ‚ÄúDo not hallucinate‚Äîanswer with ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô if unsure‚Äù

Learning strategies:
- Build a daily habit: 30‚Äì60 minutes on one skill, one micro-project per week
- Read one paper summary a day; re-implement key ideas monthly
- Teach back: write short posts or notebooks to cement understanding

FAQ:
- The model made stuff up‚Äîwhat now? Add citations requirement, use RAG, reduce temperature, constrain outputs
- My training is unstable‚Äîwhat now? Lower LR, increase batch norm/grad clip, warmup schedule, check data pipeline

Advanced notes:
- Use evaluator LLMs to critique outputs against reference rubrics for faster iteration

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

Overview:
- Opinionated checklists for data, modeling, evaluation, and operations.

Data management:
- Validate schemas and ranges; assert invariants early
- Handle missingness explicitly; document imputations
- Normalize/standardize with train-only statistics; avoid leakage
- Version datasets; record provenance

Model development:
- Start simple; measure; only then scale
- Use experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Practice error analysis; prioritize by impact
- Keep configuration in code + YAML for reproducibility

Evaluation:
- Split strategy: train/validation/test; time-based splits for temporal data
- Perform ablations; report confidence intervals
- Calibrate probabilities when decisions depend on thresholds

Ethical AI:
- Bias audits; fairness metrics where applicable
- Privacy: PII handling, minimization, secure storage
- Transparency: model cards, data statements, user notices

Deployment and MLOps:
- CI for tests/linting; CD for model packaging
- Online monitoring: drift, quality, latency, cost
- Rollbacks and canaries; feature flags for safe launches

Actionable checklist before release:
- [ ] Reproducible training and seeds
- [ ] Documented data sources and licenses
- [ ] Unit/integration tests for pipelines
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

FAQ:
- How do I pick metrics? Align with user value, segment results, and check calibration
- How to control costs? Quantize/prune, cache, batch, choose efficient architectures

Advanced notes:
- Consider safety layers: content filters, red-teaming, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop escalation
